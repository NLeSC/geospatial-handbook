# Available data

There are a large number of datasets publicly available. Some are created by the Dutch government and available under permissive licenses. For official purposes, their use is even required. These datasets are mostly maintained by the Dutch Kadaster, and available via the PDOK website (www.pdok.nl). Also, the Dutch bureau for statistics (CBS) publishes some data there. Below, I list the datasets we chose to base our urban dataset on. I also list some datasets with which I have some experience, or which I believe are of good quality, but did not use for our project.

## AHN2
website: [http://www.ahn.nl/wat_is_het_ahn](http://www.ahn.nl/wat_is_het_ahn)

Height map of the Netherlands, 50cm resolution. Available as point cloud, or gridded. [The AHN2 is now *open data*](http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/nieuws/2014/03/05/gratis-gebruik-van-actuele-digitale-hoogtekaart-van-nederland.html)

## OHN
website: geodesk Wageningen University / Alterra

Derived of the AHN2 datasets, this datasets contains 3 layers: elevation, object height above elevation, and total height (ie. elevation + total height). Useful for finding the height of objects like buildings, trees etc. Data is available for AHN2 users, via the geodesk of the WUR.

## TOP10NL (Kadaster)
website: [TOP10NL](https://www.kadaster.nl/web/artikel/productartikel/TOP10NL.htm)

Description of the infrastructural and built-up Netherlands, in vector format. Also available as raster on several levels of detail. Contains all buildings, roads, rivers, etc. and gives a land-use indication. Accuracy in the order of centimeters. Official format is GML (xml extended with GIS attributes) and is freely available via pdok (see below). Is used in the Summer in the City project, and a DVD from autumn 2013 is available.

## Buurt en Wijk
website: [nationaalgeoregister](http://www.nationaalgeoregister.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/search#|71c56abd-87e8-4836-b732-98d73c73c112)

Geometry of all local municipalities 'gemeenten' and neighborhoods 'buurten' of the Netherlands. Additional demographics from CBS are included.

## Digitale Kleuren Luchtfoto Nederland 2008 
website: [(DKLN2008)](http://www.bestel3d.nl/nl/en/data/dkln-imagery), Copyright Eurosense B.V.,2008

Aerial photos of the Netherlands, in full color (RGB) and infrared. Taken mostly during summer, in the same year (2006?). There are some areas taken later in the year, with notably lower NDVI. However, because of the ndvi does not drop below the cut-off used, the effect on the urban fraction map is minimal.


## Links to additional datasets

Those datasets were considered, but not used for various reasons (match with other dataset, availability, actuality, provenance, ...).
