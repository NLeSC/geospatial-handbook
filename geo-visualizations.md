### eWaterCycle Demo

For the eWaterCycle project we would like to have a demo that tries to get as close as we can get to the [movie we made in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOZYCBY3yz4). The plan is build this from existing parts as much as we can. Below is a quick sketch of the design of the system when complete.

### Summer in the City

Website is in progress [here](http://www.met.wau.nl/summerinthecity)

For the summer in the city project we have two plans for visualization:
* We will produce high-resolution weather forecasts for wageningen and/or amsterdam. The goal is to make these accessible to people via a website or app. 
* We have produced a high-resolution description of the netherlands: landuse, city statistics. From this we can create interesting maps like danger of heatwaves, ...

### SIM-CITY

The aim of the [SIM-CITY project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/sim-city) is to create a framework for urban (geospatial) assisted decision support. We plan to make an interactive user interface to modify parameter sets and start sets of simulations. Within that user interface, geospatial data will be visualised interactively, along with relevant charts and tables. Input to the simulations include a parameter exploration algorithm and possibly real-time data sources. The framework is meant for scientists, with the intention to interact with policy makers.
