### Standards

There a quite a few standards for accessing geospatial data, most come from the Open Geospatial Consortium: http://www.opengeospatial.org/ Some standards include:

* [Web Map Service(WMS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) - Service for getting geo images (as png or jpg, etc) from some server over http
* [Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts). Tiled version of WMS.
* [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs):  Service for getting multi-dimensional coverage (raster) data from some server.
* [Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps): Processing on coverage data. Implemented as an extension on WCS, so server-side processing can be done on data while retrieving it.
* [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs): Service for getting geo references "features", for instance shape files.
* [Web Processing Server (WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps): Service for processing on data while keeping it on the server.
* [Keyhole Markup Language(KML)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml) - xml standard for
annotations of maps.

### Data Servers

Some implementations of the above standards include:

* [Hyrax](http://www.opendap.org/) - OPeNDAP Reference Server Implementation. Serves NetCDF4, HDF5, and others, over http.
* [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) - Geospatial data server. Serves data from a variety of sources as WMS, KML, and other standard formats
* [EarthServer](http://www.earthserver.eu): reference implementation of WCPS, based on Rasdaman. Includes a number of showcase "lighthouse" applications at http://earthserver.bgs.ac.uk/
* [ncWMS](http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/): WMS server that can read data from netCDF/CF (Climate and Forcasting conventions) files, with very little configuration required.
* [THREDDS](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/TDS.html): swiss-army knife server for data. Distributed as WAR. Supports OPeNDAP, WMS, WCS, HTTP. Even includes ncWMS. See http://data.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html for an installation at NOAA.
* [MapServer](http://mapserver.org): swiss-army knife webserver for data, written in C. Supports WMS, WFS, WMC, WCS, and others. usually ran on Apache or IIS.
* [CEDA WPS Server](http://ceda-wps2.badc.rl.ac.uk/ui/home). Allows server-side processing on data sets using CDO tools. http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-4565.pdf
* [ZOO Project](http://www.zoo-project.org/) Framework for creating and chaining WPS services.

### Open Source Geospatial Foundation

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo, http://www.osgeo.org), supports the "collaborative development of open source geospatial software, and promote its widespread use.

- Lots of interesting hosted/supported projects available on the website: http://www.osgeo.org
- Bootable live cd/dvd/usb stick/virtual machine with a lot of geo software pre-installed: http://live.osgeo.org
- Screenshots and short intro of _a_lot_ of geo software (all included in the live dvd) http://live.osgeo.org/en/presentation/index.html


### Data processing

* [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) Processing (transformation, format conversion) of vector and raster data. Supports most formats, including proprietary ESRI formats when ESRI libraries are installed. Java bindings exist. License: X/MIT

* [Proj.4](http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/) Cartographic projection library (lat,lon) -> (a lot). Implements all projections you will ever use or need. Don't try to do this yourself. The library is used in most open source GIS software. Licence: MIT

* [JHMaps](http://www.jhlabs.com/java/maps/proj/) Compatible alternative for PROJ.4. Pure java project. License: Apachev2

* [PostGIS / PostgreSQL](http://postgis.net/) Geospatial extension to PostgreSQL. Implements geospatial queries (intersections, unions, etc.) on vector and raster data. Raster functions require at least version 2.0. Licence is GPLv2.

* [Fiona](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona) and [Shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) Alternative to the vector part of PostGIS. Fiona provides clean python bindings to GDAL, Shapely implements GIS operations (intersections, unions, etc.). Both are under a BSD license.

* [JTS](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm) Java Topology Suite. Original java implementation of many GIS operators. License LGPL. (v3?). Is reimplemented in C++ as [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/). License LGPLv2.1
